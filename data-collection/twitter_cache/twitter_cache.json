America voted for Biden and there's no evidence of widespread fraud. Republican officials have had enough moral backbone to ignore trump's pleading to overturn the election and let him stay in office even though he lost. He's out", "@Natasha10661923 @___omj @Spartan10256 @TX_WalkerRanger It won't. America voted for Biden. Trump throwing a tantrum doesn't change that", "@smilingcobra1 Haha a classic. \"I have no evidence, I just feel like it's true.\" Democrats really have pulled off the crime of the century if they rigged an election and left so little evidence that every republican judge has tossed fraud lawsuits and Republican congressmen say biden won", "@boaz_eric @StephenMatey3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 I believe him because he wouldn't go against Trump unless it was legit. He's been doing everything he can to help Trump and now you think he led a fake investigation so he could help elect biden?

Even bill barr is in on this plot to elect biden. How can a president just spout conspiracy theories from an official podium?", "@boaz_eric @StephenMatey3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 The 2000 election was much much closer. It's a different situation.  To be clear, you're saying that biden won the election and that it will go to the supreme court where Republicans will steal it for Trump.", "@boaz_eric @StephenMatey3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 Trump has lost in ALL SIX states where he tried to block the certification. Biden clearly won the election and will be our president on January 20, 2021.

Cuz he said his DOJ has found nothing that would change the election", "@boaz_eric @StephenMatey3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 You're all about conspiracy theories. The fact is trump's team is still getting crushed by the courts, trump himself has multiple state and federal lawsuits pending against him waiting til he's out of office, and the investigation into biden turned up no wrongdoing", "@StephenMatey3 @VogeliusDennis @danni_baby @smoyher3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 Idk if you're doing it intentionally or if you just dont know the facts but you're completely misrepresenting what Biden said.  https://t.co/Q3eHMOQtNO", "@StephenMatey3 @VogeliusDennis @danni_baby @smoyher3 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @Transition46 Haha trump's cabinet has the fewest non-whites of any cabinet in a very long time. Now, I'm not a huge biden guy either, but thinking trump's a good dude is just moronic. He's racist and narcissistic and dangerous", "@CaliSweethear10 @MelTravisLayton @catturd2 Show me evidence that biden extorted foreign officials. Trump we KNOW has done that.

You're basically alleging a grand conspiracy among all judges, Democratic and Republican, to illegally elect biden. I want you to think about how ridiculous that sounds", "@POTUS_Forever @majesticsquishy @RichardYanker @JennaEllisEsq I mean you can support whoever you want. But the fact is biden won the election by a landslide in both the popular vote and the electoral college, and there's been no evidence of widespread fraud", "@POTUS_Forever @majesticsquishy @RichardYanker @JennaEllisEsq Right you're saying you want it to come to a scotus vote despite the fact there is zero evidence of trump's voter fraud claims. The people voted for Biden and you want that overturned", "@POTUS_Forever @majesticsquishy @RichardYanker @JennaEllisEsq Haha you really think he'd talk about the voter fraud they were committing at a press conference? There's no evidence of fraud. Not a shred. Zero. It never happened. Republicans are congratulating biden and harris and telling Trump to concede.
